                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was born of the unification of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, which previously had been distinct states joined in a personal union, under the Acts of Union in <time datetime="1701">1701</time>. The island of Ireland, also joined via a personal union, was incorporated under the Acts of Union in <time datetime="1800">1800</time>, while Wales had been part of the Kingdom of England since the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The UK has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rapid expansion of the British Empire despite the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, and at its zenith in the early 20th century, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface.</p>
                <p>The first half of the 20th century saw two World Wars seriously deplete the UK's strength and the Irish Republic withdraw from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation.</p>
                <p>The UK ws an active member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> after its accession in <time datetime="1973">1973</time>. However, motivated in part by frustration at a remote bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the country, UK citizens on <time datetime="2016-06-23">23 June 2016</time> voted to leave the EU. The UK became the only country to depart the EU on <time datetime="2020-01-31">31 January 2020</time>, after prolonged negotiations on economic and security relationships had been hammered out.</p>
